<p>One of the main drawbacks to the utilization of the structured data on the WWW lies in the blatant cognitive gap between the informational needs of users and the structure of existing knowledge bases.</p>
<p>Due to the sheer size of large knowledge bases, users can hardly know which identifiers are available or useful for the construction of axioms or queries. As a consequence, users might not be able to express their informational need in a structured form. Yet, users often have a very precise idea of what kind of results they would like to retrieve. We describe a SPARQL learning web service called SPARQR that is able to learn OWL classes for given positive and negative examples. We present a public, open-source demo for this task, which is able to use OWL reasoning and convert its results to SPARQL queries.</p>
<h2 id="demo.">Demo.</h2>
<p><strong>DL-Learner</strong> is the framework to learn concepts in description logics and all its learning algorithmsare exposed over the web service. Under <a href="http://sparqr.%20dl-learner.org">http://sparqr. dl-learner.org</a> a demo of SPARQR is available. The REST interface is reachable under <a href="http://sparqr.dl-learner.org/%20interfaces/rest">http://sparqr.dl-learner.org/ interfaces/rest</a> All the code and the examples are availablevia the DL-Learner project <a href="http://aksw.org/Projects/DLLearner">http://aksw.org/Projects/DLLearner</a>.</p>
